# I like to keep all my projects sleek, and built in dark mode. Focus is for the website to be responive and work well on all platforms.

# Built with vanilla javascript, html and css.

# Highlight features:

## - Click to copy event on my email.

## - Event handlers for both click and keydown events on the same element.

## - Custom tooltip popup

# Future additions:

## A PEMDAS version. (multiple inputs) Whereas this version is single input.
